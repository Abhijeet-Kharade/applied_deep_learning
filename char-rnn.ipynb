    "In this final notebook we'll work in Tensorflow directly. I would recommend getting familiar with how neural networks work by using our previous examples and then once you feel comfortable with Keras and all of the high level concepts move into Tensorflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow does give us a few helper functions to facilitate the construction of neural networks, but mostly we will be building lots of things from scratch. The one thing that we definitely don't want to do is calculate the backward pass for our training steps, luckily this is something that Tensorflow will do for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will create a GRU recurrent neural network to use in our character level RNN. The steps for creating this network from scratch will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize all of our weight matrices. Setup their sizes and fill with random numbers\n",
    "* Define the calculations that our network must carry out\n",
    "\n",
    "A GRU cell is basically a change in the way that the hidden state is calculated for a recurrent neural network. So to begin we'll start with a vanilla recurrent neural network and show how we can create one using the two steps above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanilla RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations for a recurrent neural network look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![rnn](images/rnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create that we need to set up three matrices and two bias vectors. The specify the calculations in exactly the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Uh = tf.get_variable(\"Uh\", [input_size, hidden_size], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.1))\n",
    "Wh = tf.get_variable(\"Wh\", [hidden_size, hidden_size], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.1))\n",
    "Vy = tf.get_variable(\"Vy\", [hidden_size, vocab_size], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.1))\n",
    "bh  = tf.get_variable(\"bh\", [hidden_size], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.1))\n",

    "ys_t = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(hs_t, Vy) + by)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple enough. Input_size and output_size will change depending on the properties of our data. Hidden_size is a hyperparameter that we can set to anything that we wish.\n",
